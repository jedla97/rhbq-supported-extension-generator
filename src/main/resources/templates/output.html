### Bill Of Material (BOM) with supported and none supported artifacts

For convenience purposes Red Hat build of Quarkus ships with two different BOM files. One that only includes productized artifacts and one that contains both productized and community artifacts. Please note that the purpose of a Bill of Material is to align versions within a release to avoid misalignment of versions and as such it's not optimal to list supported vs not supported artifacts. For a complete list of supported artifacts please check the dedicated table on this page.

We strongly recommend to use the BOM, please use the following Maven dependency:


|GroupID | ArtifactID | Explanation |
|---- | ---- | ---- |
|com.redhat.quarkus | quarkus-product-bom | only Supported artifacts |
|com.redhat.quarkus | quarkus-universe-bom | Supported and community artifacts |

#### List of the available platformInfos versions

{#include platform-version-list /}

### Supported extensions Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.x {|{#RHBQ_2}|}
The maven dependency need to use the groupID `io.quarkus`.
We recommend to use the bom file instead of adding the dedicated version for the component.
